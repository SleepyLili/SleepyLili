### Hi, I'm Lili, welcome to my GitHub page.
I'm a programmer from the Czech republic, currently looking for work. I know Python pretty well, have an interest in functional programming and cybersecurity, and I like to write helpful READMEs and documentation.

- Most of my repositories also have remotes/mirrors at [git.kawen.site/Lili](https://git.kawen.site/Lili).
- Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lili-pavelu/

#### My Projects:
- **[Tlapbot](https://github.com/SleepyLili/tlapbot):** An Owncast add-on/bot that adds channel points and channel point redeems to Owncast. Add more interactions with viewers to your stream, similar to Twitch.
- **[Adaptive game assistant](https://github.com/SleepyLili/adaptive-game-assistant):** A command line utility to help run and manage Cybersecurity Games. Part of my bachelor's thesis project, later improved to be used in PA197 class at MUNI.
- [Pokémon Couture](https://github.com/SleepyLili/pokemon-couture): A simple tracking tool for a Pokémon game that I made when learning Elixir and Phoenix LiveView.

#### My Recent Work:
- [Tlapbot: 1.1.0 release](https://github.com/SleepyLili/tlapbot/releases/tag/v1.1.0) - The 1.1.0 release of Tlapbot added redeem categories, improved error logging, and made the redeems page prettier.
- [Tlapbot: 1.0.0 release](https://github.com/SleepyLili/tlapbot/releases/tag/v1.0.0) - The first full release of Tlapbot, with base redeems functionality, documented installation and config, available to Owncast streamers.
- [Owncast: Webhooks docs update](https://github.com/owncast/owncast.github.io/pull/85) - Updated webhooks documentation documenting new features, adding more information about confusing features, and clarifying some wording in the document
