### Hi, I'm Lili, welcome to my GitHub page.
I'm a programmer from the Czech republic. I know Python pretty well, have an interest in functional programming and cybersecurity, and I like to write helpful READMEs and documentation.

My open-source and free-time projects are also available at [git.kawen.site/lili](https://git.kawen.site/lili)

#### My Projects:
- **[Tlapbot](https://github.com/SleepyLili/tlapbot):** An Owncast add-on/bot that adds channel points and channel point redeems to Owncast. Add more interactions with viewers to your stream, similar to Twitch.
- **[Adaptive game assistant](https://github.com/SleepyLili/adaptive-game-assistant):** A command line utility to help run and manage Cybersecurity Games. Part of my bachelor's thesis project, later improved to be used in PA197 class at MUNI.
- [Pokémon Couture](https://github.com/SleepyLili/pokemon-couture): A simple tracking tool for a Pokémon game that I made when learning Elixir and Phoenix LiveView.
